# Tip Jar
An Open Source template for creators to recieve donations. [see the Github Repository here](https://github.com/Natekmbowie/tipjar) or [check out an example here](https://natekmbowie.github.io/tipjar/files/tipjar.html).

I was in the mood for working on something like this instead of doing other things I needed to get done, so what the heck. This is obviously overly generic, so I can't garuntee it's the best for you, but I figured I would lay it out in they way I would assume would be the best for the most people. You can modify it as much as you want, but below I will lay out step by step instructions that should allow you to deploy something like this without needing to know coding (you'll have to edit a bit, but I'll try to make sure it's easy enough that you can do it quickly and easily).

The goal of this project, aside from allowing me to work on something, is to hopefully make it easy for any content creators to accept tips or donations with minimal effort and without having to pay for any hosting or do any coding. Let's decrease the need for ads, support creators, and allow them control of their own little corner of the internet :)

Oh, and all default links are just filled in with placeholder stuff - e.g. QR codes to the Wikipedia page on Rick Rolls. We'll all replace that in a moment.
